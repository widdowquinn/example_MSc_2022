# README.md `notebooks`

The `notebooks` folder might contain examples of [`Jupyter`](https://jupyter.org/) or [`RMarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) notebooks. These notebook formats are powerful, dynamic documents that interleave code and text. They can be very useful for:

- working through problems as a kind of "sketchpad"
- presenting analyses elegantly in a static way
- presenting complex ideas or analyses with the code and data being analysed, so that the analysis can be modified and the effects of the changes seen immediately
- presenting interactive analyses with dynamic widgets
- writing webpages showing your work and analysis
- reusing ideas and analyses with new datasets
- presenting the entire analysis or thesis in an interactive book form

among other uses.

These could be organised in many different ways: one subfolder per kind of notebook; a different subfolder for each topic addressed; no subfolders; and so on.
